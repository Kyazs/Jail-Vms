                    The <strong>Zamboanga City Jail Visitor Management System</strong> (ZCJ-VMS) is a system created to
                    improve the visitation process for inmates and their families at Zamboanga City Jail. Our goal is to
                    make visits easier and more efficient while ensuring safety and security.

                    At ZCJ-VMS, we believe in the importance of keeping families connected during incarceration. Our
                    mission is to support these connections, which can lead to better outcomes for both inmates and the
                    community. By using technology, we aim to streamline the visitation process and enhance security.
